DETAILS
----------
akin to the google search engine my vision is somewhat similar, only this would apply to the items in the api.
(refer to home wireframe)

each item in the search result would be clickable and display the name.
(refer to search results wire fram)

once clicked it would open another page and display details on the work as well as a image. 
(details include e.g creditline, geography, who made it, etc..)
(refer to artDetails wireframe)
