# the-metro-muesuem-art

SUMMARY
---------
react API made with the metropolitan muesuem of art api, it features over 400,000 peices on its api, its organized by item id. this api requires no key. each item listed has in depth details. 
                                                            
DETAILS
----------
akin to the google search engine my vision is somewhat similar, only this would apply to the items in the api.
(refer to home wireframe)

each item in the search result would be clickable and display the name.
(refer to search results wire fram)

once clicked it would open another page and display details on the work as well as a image. (details include e.g creditline, geography, who made it, etc..)
(refer to artDetails wireframe)

i plan on possibly adding filters but that would be a stretch goal. 
(refer to about page)

ENDGOALS
---------
on the about page would be links to the official site as well as a map to show you how far you are from the muesuem but again these are end goals
